Got it, Jitendra! Here's the **complete and properly formatted** `README.md` file content for your **Hello World Next.js App** — all within a single markdown block so you can copy and paste it directly into your repo.


# 🚀 Hello World – Next.js App

This is a simple "Hello World" application built using **Next.js** to help you get started with the framework and understand the basic project structure.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Create a New Next.js App

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
````

### 2. Choose Options During Setup

You'll be prompted to select several configuration options. Here’s what to choose and why:

* ✅ **TypeScript** – Yes
  *For type safety and better developer experience.*

* ✅ **ESLint** – Yes
  *Helps catch bugs and maintain code quality.*

* 🟡 **Tailwind CSS** – Optional
  *Choose if you want utility-first CSS styling (you can skip for now).*

* ✅ **`src/` Directory** – Yes
  *Keeps your project structure organized.*

* ✅ **App Router (recommended)** – Yes
  *Enables the new routing system with React Server Components.*

* 🟡 **Customize default import alias** – Optional
  *Useful for cleaner imports like `@/components/Button`.*

## ✏️ Modify the `page.tsx` File

After setup, navigate to the main page file:

```
src/app/page.tsx
```

Replace its content with the following:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Hello World from Next.js!</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

---

## ▶️ Run the App

Start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see your **Hello World** message on the screen.
